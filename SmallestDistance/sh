Equifax Data Breach
Equifax Inc. is a consumer credit reporting agency. Equifax collects the information on over 800 million individual consumers and more than 88 million businesses worldwide like Business Firms, Banks, lenders etc. for free and process those data and sell the processed information back to them. Along with other 2, viz. Experian and TransUnion, Equifax is the 3rd largest credit reporting agency.
In September 2017, Equifax reported a massive cyber-security breach that compromised the most sensitive personal and financial data of more than 145.5 million users. It is recorded, that the breach has taken place in between the months of mid-May and July 2017 and the  data revealed in the hack includes names, Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses, and, in some cases, driver license numbers.

Nike Zheng, a Chinese cybersecurity researcher from Shanghai, exposed a flaw in the Apache software package, Apache Struts. In merely a day interval (Zero-day Exploit), the information was provided on FreeBuf.com, a Chinese security website and soon on Metasploit, a popular free hacking tool. On March 10, hackers came to know about Equifax’s vulnerability. And soon hackers penetrated Equifax’s security. The hacks were finally noticed on July 29 2017, but by that time the breach was so deeply embedded that the company was forced to take the consumer complaint portal offline for 11 days during which the security team found and closed the backdoors, the intruders had set up.

[1) Discuss the type of security properties that were either 1) broken by adversaries, or 2) were missing from systems that allowed the issue to occur.]
Based upon the information provided by Nike Zheng, Apache has corrected the flaw in its software package which carries the code “CVE-2017-5638”, a patch for the vulnerability was released on March 7 2017. Equifax stated that the breach was expedited using this flaw in Apache Struts software package. The security patch was released on March 7th, but the company ignored to apply the security patch, which resulted in a massive data breach. This was not the only attributable cause for the breach: other factors included the insecure network design which lacked sufficient segmentation which can easily be prevented and potentially inadequate encryption of personally identifiable information (PII), and ineffective breach detection mechanisms.

[2) Discuss the power of the adversary that seemingly attacked the system (or was believed to have attacked the system). Try and estimate a dollar figure to determine how much it cost to launch the attack, and the level of expertise required by the attackers, and the number of the attackers. If the attack required specialized equipment of access, denote these, and then try and estimate the cost.]
Based upon the nature of attack it’s difficult to pin point on particular perpetrator. The attackers were really smart in a way to avoided using such tools that investigators can easily use to track the known groups. One of the hacker’s favorite hacking tool “China Chopper” has a Chinese interface, but this tool is also used outside of china, as identified by the people familiar with this malware suggested. Many of the tools used were Chinese tools, and Equifax breach has the similar fingerprint of data security invasion in recent years, which is ultimately repudiated to hackers working for Chinese intelligence. Federal Bureau of Investigation and U.S. intelligence agencies stated that it might be a nation-state wide planned breach, but that it doesn't point to China. Mandiant, the security consulting firm hired by Equifax to investigate the breach, said in a report distributed to Equifax clients on Sept. 19, didn't have enough data to identify either the attackers or their country of origin. As the adversaries are so expert that they didn’t leave any backtrack, which conveys that they are expert in breaching the security networks and were expert in programming as well.

Based upon the known facts, it’s not yet possible to estimate the cost to launch the attack as the use of Apache Software Struts package is licensed free, the tools like Metasploit and ChinaChopper are freely distributed tools and we also don’t have any clue about the number of attackers or whether a nation-state has played any role in this breach.
